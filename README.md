Global Electronics Data Analysis Project

Overview-
       This project involves data analysis for Global Electronics, a leading consumer electronics retailer. I leveraged various datasets to uncover key insights about customers, products, sales, and store operations. This  analysis aimed to support data-driven business strategies in marketing, inventory management, sales forecasting, and international pricing.

Project Objectives-
The primary objectives for this analysis include:
          >Enhancing marketing strategies by understanding customer demographics and purchasing behaviors.
          >Optimizing inventory through analysis of product performance.
          >Improving sales forecasting and guiding product development.
          >Informing store expansion and operations based on sales and store data.
          >Analyzing currency exchange rate impact on international sales.

Datasets-   
The analysis was based on five datasets:
        >Customers - Customer details such as demographics and location.
        >Products - Product specifications, pricing, and categories.
        >Sales - Transactional data capturing orders, quantities, dates, and related keys.
        >Stores - Information about store locations and attributes.
        >Exchange Rates - Currency exchange rates for international pricing analysis.

Approach-
1.Data Cleaning and Preparation:  
         >Handled missing values.
         >Converted data types (e.g., dates, numerical values).
2.Data Loading:
          >Inserted cleaned and preprocessed data into an SQL database.
          >Created tables for each data source and used SQL INSERT statements for data loading.
3.Data Analysis and SQL Queries:
          Developed 10 key SQL queries addressing the analysis goals:
                  >Customer demographic analysis
                  >Purchase patterns and preferences
                  >Product performance metrics
                  >Store performance and operational insights
                  >Currency impact on sales 
4.Data Visualization in Power BI:
          >Connected the SQL database to Power BI
          >Designed interactive dashboards for visual insights.
5.Results and EDA Report:
          >Delivered an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report summarizing:
           >Key customer demographics and behavior
           >Product and store performance
           >Sales trends and currency impact on international sales
  Included actionable recommendations to enhance marketing strategies, optimize inventory, guide product development, and inform store expansion.

Key Insights-
>Comprehensive customer segmentation and insights for tailored marketing campaigns.
>Product sales trends for improved inventory management.
>Regional sales performance for store optimization and expansion planning.
>Impact of currency fluctuations on international sales.

Requirements-
>To reproduce the analysis, install the following:
           1.Python 3.x-
           2.MySQL database
           3.Libraries: pandas, mysql-connector-python, matplotlib, Power BI  for visualization.

How to Run-
1.Data Preparation and Loading:
          Run data_preparation.py to clean and load data into the SQL database.
2.SQL Queries:
          Execute SQL queries from the queries. sql file to generate insights for each business question.
3.Visualizations:
          Connect Power BI/Tableau to the SQL database and import relevant data for visualizations.
Results-
          The EDA report and visualizations are stored in the folder, providing insights for strategic decision-making across Global Electronicsâ€™ business functions.
